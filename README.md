  A complex Recipe application with custom recipe uploads. 

---
 ##   About:
 
This application was the last and most complex project in the JavaScript course taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.
- Functionalities are implemented with vanilla JavaScript
 - I'm using an API that collects different recipes published on specialized websites. We can bookmark our favorite recipes, change the number of servings and add our own recipe.
 - The app is still under development. I am working to implement features such as shopping list and modify the form for adding new recipes and make it responsive.

### :open_book: What I learned:
- Learning about architecture and using one (MVC);
- Working with modules;
- A glimpse into what Web Development looks like;
- Working with Web Dev tools such as Webpack, Babel, etc.;
- Being comfortable with the Windows Command Prompt and NPM;
- Learning how to debug patiently;
- Making code readable.
